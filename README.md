Overview

This repository contains the completed software design document for "Draw It or Lose It," a web-based application designed for our client, The Gaming Room. This document showcases my ability to effectively work through the software design process and communicate the design to both the client and development team.

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room wanted a web-based version of their Android game "Draw It or Lose It" to be accessible on multiple platforms. Inspired by "Win, Lose, or Draw," the game involves teams competing to guess drawings. The requirements focused on multi-platform accessibility, supporting multiple teams and players, a user-friendly interface, and ensuring game integrity through unique identifiers.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I excelled at clearly articulating the technical requirements and constraints, ensuring the document was comprehensive and understandable for both the client and the development team. This clarity was crucial for aligning expectations and facilitating a smooth development process.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The design document served as a roadmap, guiding me through the development process. It was particularly helpful in ensuring that all client requirements were meticulously addressed, allowing for effective planning, task allocation, and progress tracking.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If given the chance to revise, I would focus on enhancing the system architecture view. I would provide more detailed diagrams and in-depth explanations of component interactions, improving the visualization and understanding of the proposed solution.

How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?

Interpreting user needs involves analyzing the client's requirements and considering how end-users interact with the application. I prioritized creating a seamless and intuitive user experience across all platforms. Considering user needs is critical in design to ensure the software is accessible, engaging, and fulfills its intended purpose.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

My approach to designing the software was methodical and user-centric, starting with a thorough analysis of the requirements and proceeding to a detailed documentation process. In the future, I would employ iterative design processes, incorporate user feedback loops, and utilize prototyping to refine the design before moving to development.
